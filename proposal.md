# Predicting Airbnb House Price
## Background Introduction
Airbnb is an online hospitality service company. It gives guests opportunities to rent short-term living lodgings. At the same time, hosts can lease their places to people. The lodge types include entire house, single room, shared room, apartment and more. Airbnb receive revenues and profits from collecting service fees from both guests and hosts. 

We collect data for our project from the website called Inside Airbnb.This is a website that provides data about Airbnb, including data about how Airbnb operates, how it competes with other companies which do similar business, how much are hosts making from Airbnb and more. 

## Problem Discription and Data Set

Generally, we are interested the pricing strategies used by Airbnb house owners. What kind of factors will influence the house price and how? For example, how does the house price vary with locations in different cities? What is the relationship between house price and availability?

The data set we use is part of the open source Airbnb data for nearly 100 cities posted on InsideAirbnb.com. For each city, there is a listings.csv containing all the Airbnb listings in that city and their attributes(including neighbourhood, location, roomtype, minimum of nights, number of reviews, availability, price, etc.), and a calendar.csv containing the transaction dates of those listings. In our study, we will develop several kinds of price prediction models and test them on 3-5 cities.
