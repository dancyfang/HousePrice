# Predicting Airbnb House Price

Project Motivation
Founded for no more than 10 years, Airbnb has already modified people’s thought over short term or even long term lodge. More and more people start to embrace such kind of lifestyle. Our project to recommend the price of an Airbnb stay will be valuable considering the growing impact of Airbnb.

From Airbnb hosts’ perspective, they can refer to this model and make a better decision on pricing their properties in order to maximize their profit. On the other hand, as for tourists, they can use this model to better predict the price of their stay and compare the price generated from our model to the price listed on Airbnb Website. Such a comparison enables them to make better decision of their staying. Eventually, this model can standardize the overall pricing of Airbnb and therefore attract more tourists staying in Airbnb.
