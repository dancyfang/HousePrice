# Predicting Airbnb House Price

## Problem Discription and Data Set
Generally, we are interested the pricing strategies used by Airbnb house owners. What kind of factors will influence the house price and how? For example, how does the house price vary with locations in different cities? What is the relationship between house price and availability?
The data set we use is part of the open source Airbnb data for nearly 100 cities posted on InsideAirbnb.com. For each city, there is a listings.csv containing all the Airbnb listings in that city and their attributes(including neighbourhood, location, roomtype, minimum of nights, number of reviews, availability, price, etc.), and a calendar.csv containing the transaction dates of those listings. In our study, we will develop several kinds of price prediction models and test them on 3-5 cities.
